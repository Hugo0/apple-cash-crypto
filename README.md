# Apple Cash, but Not Centralized Crap

By Gianluka Minoprio ([@glminoprio](https://x.com/glminoprio)) and Hugo Montenegro ([@uwwgo](https://x.com/uwwgo))

## Vision

[Apple Cash](https://www.apple.com/apple-cash/) has amazing UX but it's gated to ONLY iPhone users ONLY in US. We make it for everyone using crypto.

## Description

[Apple Cash](https://www.apple.com/apple-cash/)[1] has amazing UX but itsðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· **ONLY** iPhone users **ONLY** in US **AND** subject to Apples tyrannical rules and fees. It's centralized crap. It's not interoperable. Argentinians ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· can't use it. And even if they could, they'd have to pay almighty Apple rent-seeking fees and make Tim Cook's pockets even fatter.

Me and Gianluka both work in payments and are obsessed about UX. In one of our countless conversations here in Aleph we said - Apple Cash UX is so good. Can we do this with crypto and put apple cash directly in your keyboard?

Turns out you can. Now you can directly pay from:

- ...and more!

We make it for everyone using crypto. You DON'T need to KYC. You DON'T need to worry about the other person having an overpriced iPhone. You just pay. Directly in channel.

We have built and packaged releases for Arbitrum, zkSync, Avalanche, Polygon and Solana.

## Next Steps

In our opinion, every wallet should offer this to their users. If Argentinian people can just pay directly where they _already are_, without having to move to third party apps, then we can bootstrap the crypto economy and drive viral crypto adoption - every payment becomes a new user.

We care _a lot_ about UX and think we've done something really cool here. We just copied apple but turns out, we've built a better product - it's interoperable!
